<div class="about">
    In this game, the scoring technique depends on a confident factor. <br>
    Before answering the question, the players should reply whether they are confident with their answer or that they are not so sure and need help.<br>
    If the player is confident and chose the correct answer, then he/she will gain 2 points. But if the answer was wrong he/she will be fined 2 points.<br>
    meanwhile, if the player was not so sure and asked for help. He/she will be directed to a page with a hint option. <br>
    if the answer then was correct, the player will gain 1 point, and if wrong, no deduction will happen. 
    <br>
    This method encourages the player to seek help and search more before answering.
